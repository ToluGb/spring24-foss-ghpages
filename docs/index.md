# Home Landing Page for FOSS Spring 2024 

This is my capstone project for the Data Science Fellows Program for Spring 2024.

## Learnings so far from the FOSS Sessions

### Week 1

* I found the HackMD tool used for FOSS lesson 1 very interesting; I would consider using it for future work to present my work publicly.
* I enjoyed the breakout sessions; They were very interactive and insightful.

### Week 2

* I learned about what a data management plan is and its importance in the research process.
* I learned about different available licenses that determine data accessibility and usage.
* I created a Cyverse account and now have the opportunity to perform my analysis in scale on it.

### Week 3

* I learned about project management principles and tools, as well as how important they are for reproducible and transparent research.
* I learned the importance of leadership in project management activities. Most importantly, I learned more about the value of personal leadership in organizing my projects.

### Week 4

* We talked about documentation and communication with GitHub. I have been using GitHub for years but did not know how to create a website with GitHub Pages. Michele put us through the process of building a GitHub Pages Website using MkDocs. I am glad I learned this and look forward to building on it.

### Week 5
* I learned about version control, particularly how the Git version control. I had a hands-on session which was very helpful to learn how to use Git to interact with remote repositories on GitHub. I re-learned how to link my remote repository to my local machine through Git. I enjoyed the hands-on session.

### Week 6

* I learned about reproducibility and the importance of doing more of our work on the cloud. We also had a hands-on session trying out Shell on Cyverse. One thing I'm looking forward to is the time when I will need to use Cyverse resources to do my work.
